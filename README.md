## Understanding the code

### Technologies used
   - React.js for front-end development
   - Firebase firestore for back-end development
   - Netlify for deployment
   
### React.js
   - I have made use of only functional components, which are recommended over class components.
   - Usage of Context API, rather than sending props to each component, I have made use of react context API which helps me to call the desired information from any component.
### Firebase
   - I have made use of firebase's firestore for storing my backend data of users and stories.
   - Users table maintains the users who have signed up on the website, by storing the username and an array of story's IDs he has visited.
   - Stories table contains all the stories listed on the website. It stores the stories with their unique ID, each ID has the 'Content','title','total_read','cur_read' and      'image'. 
   - I'm making use of firebase authentication for signIn and signUp purpose.
